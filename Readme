# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Sentiment Forecasting System

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts stock prices by combining sentiment analysis of unstructured news data with historical stock prices. This system is production-ready with full orchestration, CI/CD, and real-time deployment.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project integrates data engineering, ML modeling, and MLOps to build a real-time stock forecasting platform using:

- **Apache Airflow** for workflow orchestration  
- **Snowflake** and **dbt** for modern data warehousing and transformations  
- **LSTM** model for time-series forecasting  
- **Docker**, **Jenkins**, and **Kubernetes** for CI/CD and scalable deployment  
- **FastAPI** for serving real-time predictions
